Description: Development files for libappimage
 Core library of the AppImage project. Reference implementation
 of the AppImage specification. https://appimage.org
 .
 AppImage provides a way for upstream developers to provide
 “native” binaries for Linux users just the same way they could
 do for other operating systems. It allow packaging applications
 for any common Linux based operating system, e.g., Ubuntu,
 Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora etc. AppImages
 come with all dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part
 of each target system in a recent enough version and will run
 on most Linux distributions without further modifications.
 .
 AppImage is the format, and AppImageKit provides a
 reference implementation.
 .
 This package contains the development files for libappimage.
