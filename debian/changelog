libappimage (1.0.4-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Drop patch update_cmake_to_look_for_dependency_targets.patch: in addition
    to a typo that makes libappimageConfig.cmake an invalid cmake script,
    the XdgUtils libraries are not actually exposed as public dependencies.
  * Update the dependencies of libappimage-dev to reflect what is actually
    searched by the cmake scripts:
    - drop xdg-utils-cxx
    - explicitly add libglib2.0-dev, and zlib1g-dev
  * Hack my previous hack in the patch enable_debianabimanager.diff to make sure
    that CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is set at the of the top-level CMakeLists.txt as it
    was passed to cmake; this fixes the generation of the cmake configuration
    files for the exported targets.

libappimage (1.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Drop the transitional libappimage0 binary: it is empty, it does not depend
    on anything, and it cannot pull the actual library as it has a different
    ABI.
  * Drop the 'testsuite' autopkgtest: it does not test the installed package,
    and it actually does nothing since the tests are disabled during the build
    (-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF is passed to cmake).
  * Update lintian override info format in d/source/lintian-overrides on line 2,
    6.
  * Set upstream metadata fields: Bug-Database, Bug-Submit, Repository-Browse.
  * Update standards version to 4.6.2, no changes needed.
  * Update the other metadata fields to the actual upstream location.
  * Replace patch upstream_fix_typos.patch with the upstream commit
    e456429dafaee3245f6e7925b64d5990ad5affe7; patch
    upstream_Fix-typos-Unsuported-Unsupported-180.patch.
  * Make sure DebianABIManager is actually applied:
    - rename the X-Debian-Abi field to X-Debian-ABI, as used by DebianABIManager
    - add X-CMake-Target: libappimage to specify the actual target to handle
    - extend the patch enable_debianabimanager.diff with some manual gymnastics:
      DebianABIManager works only with a "Debian" CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, so
      - to set it like that before including DebianABIManager (it's the very
        last bit in the top-level CMakeLists.txt, so it is fine)
      - append the link flags (which include the linker script) specified for
        the "Debian" build type to the link flags in use
    - in the symbols file:
      - switch the actual file name to libappimage.so.1.0abi1
      - switch the version of all the symbols from "Base" (i.e. none) to
        ABI_1.0_1
      - add the ABI tag symbol
    - drop the libappimage0 breaks/replaces, since the library names do not
      conflict with non-ABI ones
  * Improve the install files to be more precise.
  * Drop the libgtest-dev build dependency, as it is not needed (the tests are
    not built).
